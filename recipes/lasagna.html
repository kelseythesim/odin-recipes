          <p>
            Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over
            medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7
            minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley,
            garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low
            and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted
            water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring
            occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.
            Drain and set aside.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 275 degrees F
            (190 degrees C).
          </p>
          <p>
            Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon
            fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of
            a 9x12-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of
            noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese
            mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella
            cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese
            mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum
            foil.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and
            bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and
            serving.
