    <h2>Homemade Lasagna Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade
      lasagna recipe:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound
        ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
      </li>
      <li>
        Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.
        Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed
        tomatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush
        one clove of garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the
        tomatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried
        basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for
        uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan.
        You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a
        binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the full,
    step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can
    expect:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and
        crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir
        in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5
        teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until
        they're al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the
        remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe
        (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is
        assembled.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for
        about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is
        golden brown.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      In an oven preheated to 275 degrees F, this homemade lasagna should be
      perfectly baked in about 50 minutes (20-40 minutes covered, 5-10 minutes
      uncovered).
    </p>

    <h2>How to Store and Freeze Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      Allow the homemade lasagna to cool completely, then transfer the leftovers
      to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to four days.
      Reheat in the oven or in the microwave.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you plan to freeze lasagna, it's best to bake it in a foil pan. Allow
      it to cool completely, then tightly wrap the entire dish in storage wrap.
      Next, wrap it in at least one tight layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up
      to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight and reheat in the oven or
      microwave.

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <p>
        Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high
        heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion
        and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley,
        garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and
        simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water
        to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring
        occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain
        and set aside.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (190
        degrees C).
      </p>
      <p>
        Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh
        parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a
        9x12-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles
        over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of
        the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers
        once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and
        mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and
        bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and
        serving.
